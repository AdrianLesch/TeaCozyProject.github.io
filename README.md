# TeaCozy-Project

This was the first off-platform project from the Codecademy Fullstack Engineer Career-Path.
The scope of this project was to use the up until then learned HTML & CSS skills and build a responsive website
with VSCode using a given design spec.

## Here is the original project scope from the Codecademy-Website:

### Off-Platform Project: Tea Cozy
In this project, you will create a fictional tea shop website on your own computer.

We will provide a design spec and image assets to help you along the way. A design spec is an image of a web page outlined with all of its CSS properties and values. These are usually created by a designer as a source of instructions for a web developer. This project assumes that you will be able to reproduce the basic HTML and CSS with little guidance.

The images and design spec you need to complete the project are listed below.
